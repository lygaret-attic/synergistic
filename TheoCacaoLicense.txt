NanoLife written by Scott Stevenson.

The purpose of this code is to provide an example of how to
write Mac software.

You may use this code for any purpose, though I ask you receive
permission before re-using any substantial portion of it in a
tutorial of your own. For info: theocacao at mac dot com.

An acknowledgement in release notes of your software is always
appreciated, but not required.
